# Python-Project--Economic-Well-Being-Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to explore the relationships between economic well-being, demographic changes, and life expectancy. By examining various factors such as income trends, population demographics, and gender disparities, the analysis seeks to understand how these elements interact and influence public health outcomes.

The primary objectives of this project are:

1. **Understand Income Trends Over Time**:  
   Explore how per capita income has evolved over time and across different geographic regions of the United States. This includes investigating growth rates, regional disparities, and income distribution patterns.
   
2. **Investigate Correlations Between Income and Population Demographics**:  
   Analyze the correlation between income trends and demographic changes, particularly age group distribution, to identify how shifts in the population might affect economic indicators.

3. **Assess the Relationship Between Income and Life Expectancy**:  
   Evaluate the correlation between household income and both race-adjusted and unadjusted life expectancy to understand the impact of economic factors on public health.

4. **Identify Gender Disparities**:  
   Investigate whether gender influences the relationship between income and life expectancy. This involves exploring how males and females may experience different outcomes in terms of economic well-being and health.

## Domain of Interest

This project lies at the intersection of **economics**, **demography**, and **public health**. Specifically, it explores the following areas of interest:

- **Economic Well-Being**:  
  Understanding how income levels, economic disparities, and wealth distribution shape societal outcomes. This includes investigating trends in per capita income, economic growth, and regional disparities in wealth across the United States.
  
- **Demographic Analysis**:  
  Examining shifts in the demographic composition of the population, with a focus on age group distribution, gender differences, and how these changes relate to economic trends. The demographic landscape significantly influences economic growth, labor markets, and policy formulation.
  
- **Public Health**:  
  Analyzing how socioeconomic factors, such as household income, correlate with life expectancy and overall health outcomes. This is particularly important for understanding public health disparities and informing policy decisions that aim to address health inequalities across different racial, ethnic, and gender groups.

This domain is crucial for policymakers, economists, public health professionals, and demographers to understand how these interrelated factors affect the well-being of populations and how future policy decisions can mitigate disparities in health and economic outcomes.
