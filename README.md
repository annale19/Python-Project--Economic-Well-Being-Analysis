# Python-Project--Economic-Well-Being-Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to explore the relationships between economic well-being, demographic changes, and life expectancy. By examining various factors such as income trends, population demographics, and gender disparities, the analysis seeks to understand how these elements interact and influence public health outcomes.

The primary objectives of this project are:

1. **Understand Income Trends Over Time**:  
   Explore how per capita income has evolved over time and across different geographic regions of the United States. This includes investigating growth rates, regional disparities, and income distribution patterns.
   
2. **Investigate Correlations Between Income and Population Demographics**:  
   Analyze the correlation between income trends and demographic changes, particularly age group distribution, to identify how shifts in the population might affect economic indicators.

3. **Assess the Relationship Between Income and Life Expectancy**:  
   Evaluate the correlation between household income and both race-adjusted and unadjusted life expectancy to understand the impact of economic factors on public health.

4. **Identify Gender Disparities**:  
   Investigate whether gender influences the relationship between income and life expectancy. This involves exploring how males and females may experience different outcomes in terms of economic well-being and health.

## Data Sources
- **U.S. Census Bureau Data**: For demographic data and per capita income statistics.
